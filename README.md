# Flick
Copy and paste to the cloud with Flick.

With a simple flick gesture, upload text and photos from your iPhoneâ€™s clipboard to Dropbox. Uploaded files are easily accessible from Dropbox on your personal computer, and are also displayed within Flick so you can quickly view, re-copy, and share your pastes.

This app was live [in the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flick-clipboard-manager/id887297274) for several years, but I've decided it's no longer worth maintaining. Flick was entirely functional upon last assessment, but is no longer available on the App Store. Please feel free to pull this repo and build to your phone, or use this code for whatever you like.
